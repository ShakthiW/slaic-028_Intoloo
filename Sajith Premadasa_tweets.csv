The Marxist NPP is planning a social experiment by introducing liberal democratic values post-election. But is #SriLanka really in a position for experiments? I believe only stability can come from #SJB's @sajithpremadasa as the next president.,Sajith Premadasa,1
Bro. I hope on Monday after the election you guys meet up and take a decision to chase away SP and appoint a new leader who can take SJB to victory in the next parliamentary election.,Sajith Premadasa,0
So JVP PM is Gona be tilvin? What a disaster it will be ü§¶ hadunethi as finance minister who thinks Cuba is great and now this guy as PM. Think twice chaps. @sajithpremadasa has the ground support and the best team. Don't break the vote and complain later #SriLanka #lka,Sajith Premadasa,1
Guys! This is the @GotabayaR version 2. #Gota never came to any debate or interview with @SirasaTVlk or @adaderanasin! His team covered him from the media. We all paid the price. Don't repeat the same mistake by electing this dummy! @sajithpremadasa - Pull up your pants and do a live interview with another media outlet. Sri Lankans deserve that. #LKA #SJB #lka #‡∂∏‡∑ù‡∂©‡∂¥‡∑î‡∂≠‡∑è,Sajith Premadasa,0

Please don‚Äôt fall for NPP‚Äôs fairy tale promises and let the country to collapse again. Consequences will be severe if that happens. Comparatively SJB has the right policies with the right team. @sajithpremadasa,Sajith Premadasa,1
RW and JVP deal is sealed. These are facts. JVP has printed their manifesto at wije news papers. Only force to take down JVP is @sjbsrilanka and @sajithpremadasa who has the best team to take this country forward. Let's not get fooled over deal politics. Shame on JVP #srilanka,Sajith Premadasa,1
This is what Sajith Premadasa has done to this country. He is just as much a part of the problem. Think a million times before even considering voting for him.,Sajith Premadasa,0
"Sajith Premadasa is someone who might avoid a diplomatic invitation due to his superstitious beliefs. In this video, Ambassador Gurjit Singh reveals why SP didn't visit India.
Can you really trust someone like SP for the top position of this country? Do you think any team can 'fix' him? If that were the case, he would have gone.",Sajith Premadasa,0
"Sajith Premadasa has produced two separate manifestos, which one will they follow? Anura Kumara Dissanayake supports the President's plan to expand our markets into foreign countries, but Sunil Handunetti says they want to abolish the FTAs. 
Do either have a clear plan?",Sajith Premadasa,0
