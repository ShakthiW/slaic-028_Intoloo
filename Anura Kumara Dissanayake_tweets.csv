"We‚Äôve had our fair share of debates and arguments with MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake. We‚Äôve clashed many times. But he has never stooped to such third-rate insults like some of his followers are doing now. Honestly, they‚Äôre not hurting us‚Äîthey‚Äôre sabotaging him. 
Here‚Äôs a post from a follower of MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake that said, ‚ÄúWhen Pina took over the country, the total foreign debt was 71 billion dollars. Now it‚Äôs 100.‚Äù
Our country‚Äôs total foreign debt is 37 billion dollars. But this person is falsely claiming it is 71 billion. And they are saying that over the past two years, our debt has increased to 100 billion dollars. But after declaring we couldn‚Äôt pay our debt, everyone knows that no country has given us any loans. No country has the legal right to lend us money.
So, what is the purpose of spreading these lies? Are your followers trying to bring your party to power one day through lies?",Anura Kumara Dissanayake,0

"As a presidential candidate, if Anura Kumara Dissanayake is intimidating the Tamils in the North on how they should vote, I wonder what he would do if elected President?
Strange tone from a man who said he wants to ""wipe out racism."" ",Anura Kumara Dissanayake,0
"Another empty election promise by Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Send SMS updates on how taxpayers‚Äô money is spent is a logistical nightmare of tracking every rupee spent, categorising it, and spending billions of tax money on those including sending millions of SMS messages. This would be a colossal waste of resources ironically funded by taxpayers‚Äô money. Anura Kumara should think about implementing real fiscal transparency measures. But then again President Ranil Wickremesinghe has already started working on that with the Public Financial Management Bill and the Economic Transformation Bill.
