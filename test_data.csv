"We‚Äôve had our fair share of debates and arguments with MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake. We‚Äôve clashed many times. But he has never stooped to such third-rate insults like some of his followers are doing now. Honestly, they‚Äôre not hurting us‚Äîthey‚Äôre sabotaging him. 
Here‚Äôs a post from a follower of MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake that said, ‚ÄúWhen Pina took over the country, the total foreign debt was 71 billion dollars. Now it‚Äôs 100.‚Äù

No country has the legal right to lend us money.
