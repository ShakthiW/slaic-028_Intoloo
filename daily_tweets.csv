ü§î how easily you insult the man who took up the challenge #srilankancrisis that you ran away from. The only reason we can even afford to hold an election for you to sling mud is cus @RW_SRILANKA saved #SriLanka from a complete economic collapse.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
Put @RW_SRILANKA as the second preference. Don't under any circumstances make it seem more like you are campaigning against him as by doing so you are giving away any obligation he will have to you after he wins the election. Electorally it will make no difference to the outcome.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,1

2)Whatever he say today  he will do that future.",Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
Sri Lanka is in a critical situation. We can't allow Sri Lanka to be another Bangladesh . We can't do experiments right now.  We can't think about our political parties right now. We can think about that political parties for upcoming general election.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,1

"The final week and 
@RW_SRILANKA storms past @sajithpremadasa
 
RW's campaign has gained unbelievable momentum in the last 3 weeks. There are ""reasons"" for this. 

SP now stands at 3rd position with AKD in the 1st position. 

Ground sources tell us that SP votes are switching to RW and a considerable amount of the undecided votes are being secured by RW, whilst another significant portion is being secured by AKD. 

The Brethren are closely monitoring the situation and urge Sri Lankans to practice restraint at all times. This election will change the fortunes of Sri Lanka forever. 

We also want to take this opportunity to request both @anuradisanayake and @RW_SRILANKA the two front runners of the election to keep all their stakeholders briefed on the importance of maintaining peace and law and order. 

The Brethren will continue to observe matters closely and will inform Sri Lankans on the future happenings as it happens.

"We‚Äôve had our fair share of debates and arguments with MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake. We‚Äôve clashed many times. But he has never stooped to such third-rate insults like some of his followers are doing now. Honestly, they‚Äôre not hurting us‚Äîthey‚Äôre sabotaging him. 
Here‚Äôs a post from a follower of MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake that said, ‚ÄúWhen Pina took over the country, the total foreign debt was 71 billion dollars. Now it‚Äôs 100.‚Äù
Our country‚Äôs total foreign debt is 37 billion dollars. But this person is falsely claiming it is 71 billion. And they are saying that over the past two years, our debt has increased to 100 billion dollars. But after declaring we couldn‚Äôt pay our debt, everyone knows that no country has given us any loans. No country has the legal right to lend us money.
So, what is the purpose of spreading these lies? Are your followers trying to bring your party to power one day through lies?",Anura Kumara Dissanayake,0

"Another empty election promise by Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Send SMS updates on how taxpayers‚Äô money is spent is a logistical nightmare of tracking every rupee spent, categorising it, and spending billions of tax money on those including sending millions of SMS messages. This would be a colossal waste of resources ironically funded by taxpayers‚Äô money. Anura Kumara should think about implementing real fiscal transparency measures. But then again President Ranil Wickremesinghe has already started working on that with the Public Financial Management Bill and the Economic Transformation Bill.
