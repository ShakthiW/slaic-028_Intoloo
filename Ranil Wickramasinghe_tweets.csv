"Thank you @RW_SRILANKA for your ACA, CIABOC and the Election Acts that forced these disclosures. Now it is up to the Big Civil Society Talkers like @tisrilanka @akeenan23 to dig into this data and lodge necc complaints at CIABOC.Will you act or sleep?",Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
ü§î how easily you insult the man who took up the challenge #srilankancrisis that you ran away from. The only reason we can even afford to hold an election for you to sling mud is cus @RW_SRILANKA saved #SriLanka from a complete economic collapse.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
Put @RW_SRILANKA as the second preference. Don't under any circumstances make it seem more like you are campaigning against him as by doing so you are giving away any obligation he will have to you after he wins the election. Electorally it will make no difference to the outcome.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
"This is not a Parliament Election. You are selecting the President. Vote RW. He got the experience, knowledge and skills to do the top job in Sri Lanka.",Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
"How can you be so sure RW will provide economic stability post election. Last time I checked, there were more taxes ready to impose which impact the middle class harshly.",Ranil Wickramasinghe,0
"IMF and world leaders will work with any leader or government chosen by the people. 

Ranil is not the owner of Sri Lanka, nor is he the president chosen by the people; rather, he was rejected by the entire country during the last election.",Ranil Wickramasinghe,0
"High time @IMFNews issue a clarification on these claims. From having @KGeorgieva's image on his manifesto to claiming that #IMF will not support any other candidates, @RW_SRILANKA is misusing #IMF for his election campaign to a great extent.",Ranil Wickramasinghe,0
Yo take this hard pill to swallow - RW will never win a presidential election in his lifetime.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,0

"If Sri Lankans are intelligent definitely president Ranil Wicremesinghe will be next president on 22.09.2024.
Why?
1) He has already proved that he can overcome any crisis(others run away from problems. only talks no work) 
2)Whatever he say today  he will do that future.",Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
Sri Lanka is in a critical situation. We can't allow Sri Lanka to be another Bangladesh . We can't do experiments right now.  We can't think about our political parties right now. We can think about that political parties for upcoming general election.,Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
"While Ranil Wickremesinghe possessed certain qualities, his support for the Rajapaksa family proved to be his downfall.Had he conducted parliamentary elections first, followed by a presidential election, the current situation would not have arisen",Ranil Wickramasinghe,0
"This is an presidential election, not a parliamentary election. This is the only negative thing you can point out in @RW_SRILANKA",Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
"The final week and 
@RW_SRILANKA storms past @sajithpremadasa
 
RW's campaign has gained unbelievable momentum in the last 3 weeks. There are ""reasons"" for this. 

SP now stands at 3rd position with AKD in the 1st position. 

Ground sources tell us that SP votes are switching to RW and a considerable amount of the undecided votes are being secured by RW, whilst another significant portion is being secured by AKD. 

The Brethren are closely monitoring the situation and urge Sri Lankans to practice restraint at all times. This election will change the fortunes of Sri Lanka forever. 

We also want to take this opportunity to request both @anuradisanayake and @RW_SRILANKA the two front runners of the election to keep all their stakeholders briefed on the importance of maintaining peace and law and order. 

The Brethren will continue to observe matters closely and will inform Sri Lankans on the future happenings as it happens. 

The Brethren,",Ranil Wickramasinghe,1
"LTTE's spokesman late Anton Balasingam onced mentioned @RW_SRILANKA is a cunning fox. He was responsible for causing the rift between V.Prabaharan and Karuna. Sri lankan tamils, please consider when voting in the presidential election üôè
